1. In GitHub, click the green "Clone or download" button on the right side of the page.
2. Copy the URL using the Clipboard button or by selecting the link and copying it.
3. In your terminal, navigate to the folder you want to place the project in.
4. type `git clone [URL]` and hit enter.  The repo will be copied to your computer.
`git clone https://github.com/flaura42/restaurant.git`
5. Navigate to the project folder (restaurant).
6. From here, you will want to start a simple HTTP server.  One option is to use Python's Simple HTTP Server.  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
